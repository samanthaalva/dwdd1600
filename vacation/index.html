This is all accessible from Escalante City, a small town located along Utah’s Byway 12. They hold roughly 850 residents and hope bring a “unique charm” to their corner of Southern Utah.</p>
        <p>Escalante was named after Silvestre Velez de Escalante, the first European explorer in this region and a Fransiscan missionary. His journey is usually called “the Dominguez-Escalante Expedition”. It’s important to note that him and his companions were some of the first white men to traverse Utah’s beautiful landscapes.</p>
        <p>During the Black Hawk Indian War of the 1860’s, individuals from the Southern Utah Militia passed through the Escalante area. They located wild potatoes in the area and named a valley, east of the Escalante Mountains, Potato Valley. After investigating Escalante in 1872, a group of settlers from Panquitch met with members from the John Westly Powell expedition. Powell’s group suggested honoring Silvestre Velez de Escalante by founding Escalante in his name. Escalante was finally settled in 1875.</p>
