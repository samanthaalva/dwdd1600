                <p>Human expression has been a pillar of our existence since the beginning of time. Ancient Egypt, Greece, and Rome all worshipped gods with intricate tales of fancy; stories that served as important lessons for their communities. These spiritual stories featured deities like Amun-Re, Zeus, Apollo, and Nike, to name a few. The gods in these stories served an important purpose: they were the reasoning for these communities' values, lifestyles, and infrastructure. They were central to how ancient societies functioned on a day-to-day basis.<br><br>Today, we have taken story-telling and character design beyond the scope of religion. It dominates our films, social media, and comics. Even non-visual mediums, like books, describe character visuals for the readers. When well done, character design stirs emotions within viewers, carefully gives non-verbal cues to a character's nature, and foreshadows events later in the story. It aids us in our ability to communicate, regardless of whether a story is fiction. In fact, many artists indulge in character design as a hobby. It’s an enjoyable occupation without the looming threat of deadlines. Some neglect story in favor of design; others design characters through their words. You’ll find a wide range of styles, stories, and creative decisions within this community, and while no skill-level should be turned away or shunned, knowing a few tips and tricks from the professionals can boost your confidence and ability to communicate through your designs.</p>

                <p>As an artist and character designer myself, I must stress the value of creativity and just <em>how much you can do</em>. A lot of people think art is simply confined to pencil and paper. This simply isn’t true. I’ve seen everything from glass to fruit to bottle caps. Even <i>dust.</i> Artists can find anything and turn it into a medium of their own. Now, this isn’t to say that you <i>must</i> find something “unique”. I use a sketchbook myself- as well as an iPad when I prefer a digital medium. I don’t enjoy painting like other artists, and I haven’t explored mediums like fluid art. There’s nothing wrong with sticking to the tried-and-true methods of artistry, and there's nothing wrong with exploring a wide range of mediums or committing to a medium that nobody else uses. Your art doesn’t get its’ beauty from the medium- it gets its beauty from your individual style and personality. <br><br> Character design is very much the same. There are thousands of people out there who enjoy this craft, but the diversity is what makes it so exciting. Keeping these tips and tricks in mind will help your craft exponentially. However, many artists thoughtfully bend and break the rules to fit their own styles. I highly recommend looking to artists on social media for inspiration, but art is only fun when you’re expressing your true, authentic self. What genre of characters do <i>you</i> like to design? Horror? Slice-of-life? Do <i>you</i> prefer a more cartoony style, or a more realistic one? Do <i>you</i> enjoy designing monsters, robots, dragons, people? What messages do <i>you</i> want to share through your stories? Character design is a form of self-expression, so don’t limit yourself because you’re afraid of failure or “not being the best”. Every artist starts somewhere, and all art is beautiful. <br><br>I remember learning an important lesson in my AP Art History class. Before we even began the curriculum, Mrs. Pickett showed us <i><a href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/marcel-duchamp/fountain-1917" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Fountain</a></i>, created by Marcel Duchamp in 1917. This piece was a urinal, signed <i>R.Mutt</i> in big, bold letters. My teacher asked us if the work could really be considered “art”. Many students said that it wasn’t: it was simply a urinal with a name signed on it. However, Mrs. Pickett told us this: <em>”We as observers can’t judge whether or not a piece is art. We can only decide if we like it or not.”</em> Interestingly enough, this is exactly what Duchamp was trying to convey. He even submitted <i>The Fountain</i> to an art gallery under an alias and the piece was rejected, as contemporary art wasn't widely accepted at the time. This goes to show just how far artistry can go. It’s not about looking “pretty” or following societal norms. It’s about self-expression; and nobody can say you’re not an artist, or that your creations don’t “qualify” as art.</p>

              
                <p>While we've lost the original piece by Duchamp, there is a 1950 replica in the <i>Philadelphia Museum of Art</i>.</p>
