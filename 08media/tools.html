                <h1>Character Design Principles</h1>
                <h2>Shape Language</h2>
                <p>Within the scope of design, shapes play a key role in visually hinting to your character's nature. The human mind subconsciously gathers information from shapes, and designers are able to subtly imply certain aspects of a character as a result. How many times have you described a character in a certain way, without quite knowing the reasoning? I’ll include a link to a more in-depth analysis <a href="https://dreamfarmstudios.com/blog/shape-language-in-character-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, but for the time being, let me give you a basic overview of shapes.</p>
                <p>There are three main shapes designers keep in mind for character expression: Circles, squares, and triangles.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Circles have no sharp edges or lines. As they are smooth and non-threatening, these shapes are often used for youthful, innocent, and kind characters. They evoke a warm feeling and create trust within the viewers.</li>
                    <li>Squares are sturdy and reliable. Often used in our architecture for stability, these shapes are employed in characters for the same reason. They convey confidence, dependability, and strength: sometimes physically, sometimes mentally, and sometimes both.  </li>
                    <li>Triangles are associated with danger due to their sharp points and direct opposition to circles. They convey ill-intent and malice within characters. As a result, they are often used in the designs of antagonists and villains.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Side note: Shape language does not always have to be literal. There are many characters with contradictory shapes. This helps mislead the audience about a character's disposition. For example, a character may be kind, but triangular shapes are employed to visualize how other characters are wary of them. Either that, or a villain may have circular shapes in their design to create false security and therefore, a bigger shock to viewers when the story hits a turning point, and the villain is revealed.</p>
                <h2>Silhouette</h2>
                <p>While shape language helps convey a character's nature, a strong silhouette helps an audience recognize designs immediately. In the professional world of filmmaking and artistry, you want your character to be as recognizable as possible. And even if you aren’t designing for a career, it’s rewarding when people you know can distinguish your character from the thousands of characters out there. For a visual library on numerous character silhouettes (many of which you'll probably recognize), visit this <a href="https://characterdesignreferences.com/visual-library-2/character-design-silhouette" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a>!</p>
                <p>What to keep in mind when crafting a good silhouette: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Negative space: When thinking about your silhouette, make sure you’ve got some negative space to go around. Elements won’t be recognizable or impactful if they’re too close to other elements. Pick and choose what areas of your silhouette should stand out, and what should blend in. This will add emphasis to the elements you want your viewer to see.</li>
                    <li>Personality: A character's disposition and preferences will help inform your silhouette. Are they shy and wear baggy clothes? Do they wear their hair up because they’re sporty? Do they carry a large weapon because they live in a dystopian world? When you draw your character, how do they hold themselves? Do they stand with a wide stance or slump over? Thinking about how your character presents themselves, and which elements say the most about your character, will naturally add distinction to your silhouette.</li>
                    <li> Size: To expand on the previous point, you don’t want all your elements to be the same ratio. Distinguishing what tells more about the character will help you decide what needs the most attention. For example, I may design a character with big, curly hair because she’s outgoing and bubbly. However, she may have a necklace she never takes off, but the viewers don’t know why until an emotional moment. I want the big hair to dominate her design, as it informs viewers about her disposition, along with taking the attention away from her smaller necklace, which you can't even see in the silhouette. </li>
                </ol>
                <h2>Color Theory</h2>
                <p>Colors play an important, psychological role within character designs. They often influence how we see a character subconsciously, and they’re just as important as the linework of a design. They communicate emotion, stir up reactions, and make us think differently about a visual subject. Character color schemes often follow color harmonies; “the arrangement of colors to form a cohesive whole”, as characterhub.com writes. I’ll include the link <a href="https://characterhub.com/blog/character-resources/character-color-palette" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, which includes iconic character examples. With that, let me introduce you to some basic terms for color theory:</p>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Hue:</dt>
                    <dd>This refers to a ‘prime color’, or the base of a color, taken from its place on the color wheel without additional changes. It’s a color unaffected by saturation or value. In color theory, combining different hues will create color associations that stir different interpretations from your audience. As a base rule, I’d suggest using <i>roughly</i> three hues for a character pallet, one of which serves as the “accent color”. This helps keep your design connected and strong, as more colors would strain the eyes and make your character difficult to remember. However, there are other things to consider when making a good pallet.</dd>
                    <dt>Saturation:</dt>
                    <dd>This term describes the intensity of a color. Working with brighter variations of a hue results in more eye-grabbing designs, while muted colors tend to be overlooked. You want a good balance within your designs, as a character who is too saturated will strain the eyes because hues are competing for attention- especially if they have more than 2-3 colors. Utilizing these effectively will draw the audience's attention to the most important aspects of your design. In other words, those that have the highest saturation. As a fun little tip, I’d suggest using pallets with higher saturation for characters with intense personalities. However, it isn’t a must. <a href="index.html#oyster"> Different art-styles</a> may use different levels of saturation already. For example, my own style is extremely saturated in color while my friend leans towards more muted colors, regardless of who we're drawing.</dd>
                    <dt>Value:</dt>
                    <dd>This is the relative lightness (or darkness) a color has. It’s often employed in artwork to convey depth, as some elements may be darker than others. Like saturation, value can be used to guide the audiences' eyes through a composition. For example, say I have a character with dark skin and hair. Maybe he has bright blue eyes that immediately draw attention to his face, and the values gradually darken from his shirt to his pants to his boots. This directs the audience to his eyes, as these are known as windows to the soul and convey the most expression. Then, they can slowly take in the rest of his design down to his boots- without any competing elements. If his boots were bright red however, that would strain their eyes and make it hard for them to pick out one element to focus on.</dd>
                    <dt>Temperature:</dt>
                    <dd>Temperature: This defines our interpretations of whether a color is hot or cold. Red, yellow, and orange tend to read as warm. Meanwhile, green, blue, and purple are seen as cool. Warm colors often convey energy and excitement, whereas cool colors are calming to the viewer. They often express a character to be relaxed, introverted, or aloof, while warm colors express extroversion, bubbliness and a hyper disposition. These rules don’t apply to all characters however, as many color schemes employ <strong>both warm and cool colors.</strong></dd>
